                <h3>What does the company do?</h3>
                <p>When it comes to buying a house, many people immediately picture the standard single-family home.
                    These homes have largely become synonymous with the concept of homeownership. But these arent the
                    only types of houses on the market, and your dream home could actually be something very different.
                    From condos to co-ops, other types of houses offer benefits that many people overlook. We help you
                    find the right fit for you and your family.
                </p>
